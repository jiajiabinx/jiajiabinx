## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jia, and I am a Columbia U-trained computer scientist / AI data engineer. I am interested in NLP, ML, and multimodal LLM with a focus on paralinguistics attributes in speech and how that can make LLM more "emotionally intelligent" 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Echo - a language model fine-tuned on chronological textual narratives. What if we chronologically arrange textual narratives and train a model that can best predict the direction of its semantic narrative? Aka - can we make a model to predict future events?
  
- ðŸŒ± I am also the technical co-founder of [Shamiri Health](https://www.shamirihealth.com/) and shipped our first mobile/web-based app backend
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Some other fun apps that I have done
  1. [Power System ROI tool](https://github.com/jiajiabinx/power-system-roi/tree/main) Fun tool that I made for my friend in a climate tech company to quickly qualify leads.
  2. [Echo](https://github.com/jiajiabinx/echo) Echo app - AI fortune teller using LLM. I intend to use this app to carry the model that I am working on
  3. [Recylcomatron](https://github.com/jiajiabinx/recylcomatron) Robotics project - made a robot that can use computer vision to sort garbage
  4. Several language model training projects: [Auto captioning](https://github.com/jiajiabinx/auto_caption) where I trained a LSTM model to auto-caption images
  5. [Game Scout](https://github.com/jiajiabinx/game_scout) Front-end javascript project. A twitter for games
